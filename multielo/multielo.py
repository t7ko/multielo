        Estimate the probability of each player finishing in each possible

        To simulate a game including players in the
        ratings array, we generate a score for each player using a Gumbel
        distribution. If a player has rating R, then that player's score is
        sampled from a Gumbel(R, D) distribution, where D is the Elo D
        parameter. Then we rank the players in descending order of their
        scores to determine first place, second place, ..., last place. We
        count the number of times each player finishes in each place and then
        divide by the number of simulations to calculate the proportions.

        We generate scores using Gumbel distributions because of the property:
        ~~    Gumbel(a_1, b) - Gumbel(a_2, b) ~ Logistic(a_1 - a_2, b)    ~~

        The Logistic(a_1 - a_2, b) distribution is the same distribution that
        describes the pairwise win probability if two payers have Elo ratings
        a_1 and a_2. In other words, a score sampled from Gumbel(a_1, b) will
        be greater than a score sampled from Gumbel(a_2, b) with the same
        probability that a player with Elo rating a_1 will beat a player with
